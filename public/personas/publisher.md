Here’s a revised set of 12 questions (6 futuristic, 6 current) for the Publisher persona in OOH/DOOH, refined to align with your clarifications around structured marketing systems, CRM automation, Omni Media Audience Sequencing, and distribution integration:

Futuristic Questions (5–10 Years)
(Aligned with Omni Media Audience Sequencing & AI-Driven Systems)
1. Data: How will publishers orchestrate audience sequences across OOH, CTV, and retail media using real-time behavioral triggers?
Crisp: Data: Omni Media Sequencing?
Focus: Moving beyond demographics to synchronize OOH ads with CTV, mobile, and retail touchpoints based on real-time behavior (e.g., serving DOOH ads to shoppers who browsed products online).

2. Marketing: Can AI-driven CRM systems automate lead nurturing by predicting advertiser intent from OOH campaign signals?
Crisp: Marketing: AI CRM Funnels?
Focus: Using AI to analyze campaign performance data (e.g., footfall, dwell time) and auto-nurture advertisers with personalized follow-ups.

3. Distribution: Will OOH inventory become a "plug-and-play" layer in AI agent ecosystems (e.g., Google’s agentic checkout)?
Crisp: Distribution: AI Agent Integration?
Focus: Enabling brands to book DOOH ads via AI assistants without logging into marketplaces, using natural language commands.

4. Technology: How can publishers deploy blockchain-based smart contracts to automate revenue sharing with omni-media partners?
Crisp: Technology: Blockchain Revenue?
Focus: Automating payments between OOH publishers, retail networks, and CTV platforms based on attribution data.


5. People: What skills will OOH teams need to manage AI copilots that handle 80% of CRM and campaign optimization tasks?
Crisp: People: AI Copilot Oversight?
Focus: Transitioning sales teams from manual outreach to supervising AI systems that generate leads, proposals, and reports.


6. Products: Can OOH/DOOH packages evolve into "performance subscriptions" tied to omni-media KPIs (e.g., share-of-journey)?
Crisp: Products: Performance Subscriptions?
Focus: Selling guaranteed audience sequences (OOH → mobile retargeting → CTV) with bundled attribution metrics.



Current Priorities
(Aligned with CRM Automation & Vertical Integration)
1. Data: How to implement first-party audience graphs that unify OOH exposure data with CRM lead profiles?
Crisp: Data: Unified Audience Graphs?
Focus: Linking DOOH impression data (e.g., mobile IDs near billboards) to advertiser CRM systems for closed-loop attribution 7.


2. Marketing: How to replace cold outreach with inbound lead engines using SEO-optimized OOH case studies?
Crisp: Marketing: Inbound Case Studies?
Focus: Publishing data-rich success stories (e.g., "OOH drove 20% lift in e-commerce sales") to attract digital-first advertisers 8.


3. Distribution: How to integrate OOH booking APIs into vertical SaaS tools (e.g., Shopify, Salesforce)?
Crisp: Distribution: Vertical SaaS APIs?
Focus: Letting e-commerce brands book DOOH ads directly from their Shopify dashboard using pre-set budgets/KPIs.


4. Technology: What low-code tools can publishers adopt to automate lead scoring and CRM workflows?
Crisp: Technology: Low-Code CRM?
Focus: Using tools like HubSpot or Zapier to auto-score leads based on campaign engagement and trigger follow-ups 6.


5. People: How to restructure sales teams into "audience architects" who sell omni-media journeys, not billboards?
Crisp: People: Audience Architects?
Focus: Training teams to pitch OOH as part of connected sequences (e.g., "This highway billboard primes commuters for your Instagram ads").


6. Products: Can publishers offer "try-before-you-buy" OOH campaigns with dynamic creative testing?
Crisp: Products: Dynamic Trial Campaigns?
Focus: Letting advertisers A/B test creatives on DOOH screens for a week before committing to long-term buys 7.



Alignment with Google’s AI Experiment
For distribution integration, the "AI Agent Integration" question mirrors Google’s frictionless checkout:
Example: A brand’s AI assistant books a DOOH campaign via natural language: "Reserve 10 digital billboards in NYC for Q4, optimized for Gen Z foot traffic." The system auto-negotiates pricing, confirms inventory, and triggers creatives – no logins or spreadsheets 5.


Key Themes
Inbound/Outbound Balance: Structured systems to reduce cold outreach (e.g., SEO-driven case studies) while automating CRM follow-ups 8.


Omni-Media Sequencing: Audience journeys that start with OOH and flow into measurable digital actions 34.


Frictionless Buying: Embedding OOH into tools advertisers already use (e.g., Shopify, AI agents) 5.
