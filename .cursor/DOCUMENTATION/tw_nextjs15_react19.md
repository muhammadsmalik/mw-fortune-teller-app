Next.js 15 + React 19
Using shadcn/ui with Next.js 15 and React 19.
Update: We have added full support for React 19 and Tailwind v4 in the canary release. See the docs for Tailwind v4 for more information.
The following guide applies to any framework that supports React 19. I titled this page "Next.js 15 + React 19" to help people upgrading to Next.js 15 find it. We are working with package maintainers to help upgrade to React 19.
TL;DR
If you're using npm, you can install shadcn/ui dependencies with a flag. The shadcn CLI will prompt you to select a flag when you run it. No flags required for pnpm, bun, or yarn.
See Upgrade Status for the status of React 19 support for each package.
What's happening?
React 19 is now rc and is tested and supported in the latest Next.js 15 release.
To support React 19, package maintainers will need to test and update their packages to include React 19 as a peer dependency. This is already in progress.
"peerDependencies": {
-  "react": "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0",
+  "react": "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0 || ^19.0",
-  "react-dom": "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0"
+  "react-dom": "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0 || ^19.0"
},
Copy
You can check if a package lists React 19 as a peer dependency by running npm info <package> peerDependencies.
In the meantime, if you are installing a package that does not list React 19 as a peer dependency, you will see an error message like this:
npm error code ERESOLVE
npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
npm error
npm error While resolving: my-app@0.1.0
npm error Found: react@19.0.0-rc-69d4b800-20241021
npm error node_modules/react
npm error   react@"19.0.0-rc-69d4b800-20241021" from the root project
Copy
Note: This is npm only. PNPM and Bun will only show a silent warning.
How to fix this
Solution 1: --force or --legacy-peer-deps
You can force install a package with the --force or the --legacy-peer-deps flag.
npm i <package> --force
 
npm i <package> --legacy-peer-deps
Copy
This will install the package and ignore the peer dependency warnings.

What do the --force and --legacy-peer-deps flag do?
Solution 2: Use React 18
You can downgrade react and react-dom to version 18, which is compatible with the package you are installing and upgrade when the dependency is updated.
npm i react@18 react-dom@18
Copy
Whichever solution you choose, make sure you test your app thoroughly to ensure there are no regressions.
Using shadcn/ui on Next.js 15
Using pnpm, bun, or yarn
Follow the instructions in the installation guide to install shadcn/ui. No flags are needed.
Using npm
When you run npx shadcn@latest init -d, you will be prompted to select an option to resolve the peer dependency issues.
It looks like you are using React 19.
Some packages may fail to install due to peer dependency issues (see https://ui.shadcn.com/react-19).
 
? How would you like to proceed? ‚Ä∫ - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
‚ùØ   Use --force
    Use --legacy-peer-deps
Copy
You can then run the command with the flag you choose.
Adding components
The process for adding components is the same as above. Select a flag to resolve the peer dependency issues.
Remember to always test your app after installing new dependencies.
Upgrade Status
To make it easy for you track the progress of the upgrade, I've created a table below with React 19 support status for the shadcn/ui dependencies.

Recharts
To use recharts with React 19, you will need to override the react-is dependency.
Add the following to your package.json

package.json
"overrides": {
  "react-is": "^19.0.0-rc-69d4b800-20241021"
}
Copy
Note: the react-is version needs to match the version of React 19 you are using. The above is an example.
Run npm install --legacy-peer-deps
