Moving Walls - Web App Development Brand Guidelines

1. Brand Essence & Personality

Core Values: Modernity, adaptability, approachability, innovation, professionalism.
Identity: Tech-forward, innovative leader in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.
Symbolism: Movement, transformation, seamless connectivity, fluidity, progress.
Theme: "Boundless Vision" - conveying limitless possibilities, continuous exploration.
2. Logo Guidelines

Main Logo:
Dynamic "MW" mark with a flowing wave motif.
Gradient blue tones.
Modern typography: "moving walls" (all lowercase) below the "MW" mark.
Registered trademark symbol (Â®) present.
Logo Variations:
Standard: Full-color logo on a white/light background.
Dark Background: Full-color logo adapted for dark backgrounds (as shown on page 3).
Light Background: Full-color logo adapted for light blue gradient backgrounds (as shown on page 3).
Monochromatic: Black and white or grayscale versions are permissible when color printing/display is not available (page 4).
Clear Space:
Defined by the height and width of a conceptual yellow rectangle based on the middle triangle of the "MW" symbol (see page 5).
This clear space must be maintained equally on all four sides (top, bottom, left, right).
No other text, graphics, or visual elements should enter this area.
Logo Do's:
Use with primary/secondary color backgrounds or boxes.
Use B&W or grayscale if color is not an option.
Resize as needed, maintaining proportions and clear space.
Logo Don'ts:
Do not apply any effects (shadows, glows, etc.).
Do not change the logo design or alter its structure.
Do not change logo colors unless specifically for B&W/grayscale use.
Do not use the "MW" mark without the "moving walls" text or trademark (unless it's the wave motif used as a graphic element).
Do not stretch, squeeze, or distort proportions.
Logo Extension (e.g., "Moving Walls Group"):
Follows main logo's color palette and style.
Additional wording (e.g., "Group") text must match the width and height of the main logo symbol.
Font for extended text: Arial Rounded MT Bold.
Web App Relevance: This is less likely for a general app UI but good to note for potential sub-brands or specific product naming within an ecosystem.
3. Color Palette

Primary Colors (Derived from Logo Gradient & Dark Tones):
Darker Blue: #2554A2 (C:99 M:92 Y:7 K:0 | R:40 G:63 B:150)
Deep Blue/Near Black: #1B1E2B (C:82 M:75 Y:55 K:68 | R:27 G:30 B:43) - Often used for dark backgrounds or text on light backgrounds.
Secondary Colors (Lighter Blues):
Lightest Blue: #B6E2F8 (C:26 M:1 Y:0 K:0 | R:182 G:286 B:248) - Note: RGB values R:182 G:286 B:248 seem incorrect as G,B > 255. Likely R:182 G:226 B:248 if intended light blue. Assume standard RGB conversion from HEX.
Lighter Blue: #66C9F3 (C:82 M:75 Y:55 K:68 | R:102 G:201 B:243) - Note: CMYK values for this seem to be a copy of #1B1E2B, likely an error. Rely on HEX/RGB for this light blue.
Accent Color Gradients (for UI elements, highlights, CTAs):
Crimson Blend: #EE3D39 to #871AIC (Boldness, vitality, confidence)
Dark BG use: #EE3D39 to #AC2428
Light BG use: #6F1512 to #871AIC
Sunburst (Yellow/Orange): #FEDA24 to #F59C25 (Enlightenment, curiosity, uplifting)
Dark BG use: #FEDA24 to #FAAE25
Light BG use: #FCCD25 to #F59C25
Emerald Wave (Green): #6DDF6A to #25534A (Adaptability, forward-thinking, sustainable)
Dark BG use: #6DDF6A to #528857
Light BG use: #4D8C5F to #25534A
Special Event Colors (for temporary themes, promotions, unique features):
Radiant Magenta: #A30F97 to #F22CD0 (Dark BG); #8C0786 to #F22CD0 (Light BG)
Vibrant Sunset (Orange): #FF6200 to #FFA500 (Dark BG); #FF4500 to #FFA500 (Light BG)
Dynamic Teal: #028C8A to #00E3E3 (Dark BG); #028C8A to #01C6C5 (Light BG)
Font Colors:
Primary Blue: #2554A2
Full Black: (e.g., #000000 or #1B1E2B for a softer black)
Full White: #FFFFFF
Color Usage Best Practices:
Dark Backgrounds: Use gradients for highlights/CTAs (not main BG). Ensure strong contrast for text/icons. Use bright/saturated colors for small accents.
Light Backgrounds: Do not combine dark BG gradients with light BG elements. Ensure high contrast. Keep design clean, avoid thin fonts hard to read on light BGs.
When using Special Event Colors, core visual elements (Logo, Typography, Graphic Motifs) must remain consistent with main brand guidelines.
4. Typography

Primary Typeface: Poppins
Rationale: Embodies modernity, adaptability, approachability. Clean, geometric, contemporary, energetic feel. Versatile for digital interfaces. Rounded corners and tall x-height convey friendliness and ensure legibility.
Hierarchy & Weights:
Titles/Headings (H1, H2): Poppins Bold
Subtitles/Subheadings (H3, H4): Poppins Semibold (Regular & Italic)
Body Text/Paragraphs: Poppins Regular (Regular & Italic)
Buttons/CTAs: Poppins Semibold or Bold for prominence.
Font Colors: Primary Blue (#2554A2), Full Black (e.g., #1B1E2B or #000000), Full White (#FFFFFF). Ensure sufficient contrast with background colors (WCAG AA or AAA).
5. Graphic Elements & Iconography

Wave Motif (derived from "MW" logo):
Can be used as a background pattern, border, or decorative element.
Use both solid and outline forms for visual interest and consistency.
Cropping the motif at an edge can symbolize "boundless vision."
Often seen as a footer/header element in mockups (e.g., email, stationery).
Arrows (Triple Chevron):
Right-facing arrows symbolize progress and innovation.
Varying size can create visual hierarchy and rhythm.
Use to indicate navigation, progression, or draw attention.
Icons:
Style: Clean, modern, consistent with Poppins' geometric feel.
Outlines: Should be thin, recommended 1-2 pt for clarity and consistency (translate to pixel values for web, e.g., 1px or 2px strokes).
Sequence: Can alternate between solid and outline styles for variety if used in a set.
Spacing: Flexible and not restricted, but maintain visual balance.
Orientation: Can be displayed horizontally, vertically, or at any slanted angle (though for UI, horizontal/vertical is standard).
Color: Use primary, secondary, or accent colors. Ensure high contrast.
6. UI & Component Styling Principles

Layout: Clean, uncluttered, with ample white space.
Backgrounds: Utilize primary and secondary blues. The wave motif can be a subtle background texture.
Buttons & CTAs:
Use accent color gradients (Crimson, Sunburst, Emerald) for primary actions.
Solid primary/secondary colors for secondary actions.
Ensure strong text contrast.
Consider rounded corners consistent with Poppins' feel.
Cards & Containers:
Clean lines, potentially with subtle rounded corners.
Can use primary/secondary colors as fills or borders.
Interactivity: Ensure visual feedback for interactive elements (hover, focus, active states) using variations in color, brightness, or subtle animations.
Imagery: Tech-focused, dynamic, potentially incorporating the wave motif or blue color overlays if appropriate.
7. Tone of Voice (Implied)

Professional yet Approachable: Clear, concise, and confident.
Innovative & Forward-Thinking: Emphasize progress, solutions, and the future.
Dynamic & Energetic: Language should feel active and engaging.
8. Application Examples (Inspiration from provided mockups)

Social Media Posts (Page 15): Show good examples of combining logo, color, typography, wave motif, and imagery.
Email Templates (Page 19): Wave motif used as a footer. Clear hierarchy of information.
General Feel: Consistent use of the wave motif as a branding device, especially at the bottom of layouts.
This document should provide a solid foundation for designers and developers working on the Moving Walls web application, ensuring a consistent and professional brand image. Remember to always refer back to the original visual identity guide for specific visual examples.
