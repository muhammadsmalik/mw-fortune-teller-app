${businessObjective ? `The fortune should ideally align with or help them achieve their stated objective: '${businessObjective.replace(/_/g, ' ')}'.` : ''}

The fortune should focus on potential success and opportunities, especially highlighting how Out-of-Home (OOH) advertising and related technologies can play a role in a way that feels fresh and specific to them.
${geographicFocus ? `Make the 'locationInsight' particularly relevant to their '${geographicFocus}' area if possible, offering a unique OOH angle for that specific locale.` : ''}

The entire fortune must be extremely concise. When the text from all fields is read sequentially, it should ideally form a cohesive message of about 4-5 short lines. Prioritize impactful brevity and high originality for each individual field. Strive to weave in a subtle, creative, and non-obvious reference to their specific '${industryType}' if it feels natural within the mystical tone.

Ensure each insight section (locationInsight, audienceOpportunity, engagementForecast, transactionsPrediction, aiAdvice) begins its text with the specific emoji mentioned in its schema description.
